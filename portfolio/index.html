        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Healing Justice Lineages is an archival project of collective
          care and safety strategies.</p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>To continue the work of educating the community on these
          strategies, HJL wanted to create a website for people to learn
          more about the project.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>The HJL website was redesigned with a custom WordPress theme
          based on the project‚Äôs needs and design specifications, to
          reflect the organization‚Äôs dedication to promote strategies
          toward collective care. The project involved 4 months of work
          until launch, with accessibility features such as the
          low-fidelity color mode, an accessibility tagging system for
          picture descriptions, as well as a temporary password-protected
          mode.</p>

        <h2>ATT&CK Navigator</h2>
        <p>As a UX engineer at MITRE, I was responsible for the UX design
          and development for four projects at different stages: ATT&CK,
          CALDERA, and two other projects related to policymaking.
          <br><br>
          The ATT&CK Navigator and CALDERA are both public, open-source
          cybersecurity projects that are used by cybersecurity researchers
          and experts.

          Navigator</a>
        </p>
        <p><em>Angular, Node.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em></p>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>The Navigator is one of MITRE's most active projects, enabled by
          its widely-accessible platform. It visualizes an extensive
          database of known cybersecurity threats and methods.
          <br><br>
          I was a good fit to work on this team because of my prior
          experience and knowledge working with backend-heavy Angular apps.
        </p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>The ATT&CK Navigator is a large open-source project, with many
          contributors and community supporters. There are constantly many
          pull requests made on the repository to request a new feature, or
          to fix a bug. As one of the UX engineers on the small team
          maintaining the project, I was tasked with these pull
          requests.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Two new features I worked on for the Navigator, which were both
          popular requests from the community, were: 1) dark mode, and 2)
          the search and multi-select interface.
          <br><br>
          The features were tricky in that they required storing cookies to
          set the dark mode based on the user‚Äôs preference (falling back on
          their device‚Äôs default mode by using CSS and JS if unset), as
          well as updating the Angular app infrastructure to accommodate
          these two new interface features.

        <p>As a UX engineer at MITRE, I was responsible for the UX design

          CALDERA, and two other projects related to policymaking.

        </p>
        <p><em>Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Alpine.js</em></p>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>CALDERA is a cybersecurity attack simulation software, used to
          emulate red-team (adversary) and blue-team (defense) campaigns.
        </p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>The CALDERA project has built a library of APIs for simulation
          purposes, but for users who are not familiar with terminal
          interfaces, we wanted to create a more user-friendly interface to
          provide more visual feedback and call the APIs.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>I recreated the architecture flow based on the team's
          requirement that the new user interface (UI) is fairly
          non-intrusive and lightweight. The app is largely in Python, and
          used Jinja as its template rendering engine.
          <br><br>
          After some research, I found a fairly simple way to reduce code
          maintenance burden with the alpine.js library.
          <br><br>
          With faster, dynamic templates, we were free to recreate the
          CALDERA UI's look-and-feel.
          <br><br>
          I conducted user outreach to better understand the use cases of
          CALDERA's features, as well as to gain an insight into
          cybersecurity tooling basics. We were finally able to repackage
          CALDERA with a new UI, called the Alpha release.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The Operations Page is one of the most heavily-used features in
          CALDERA. It's a useful page with a lot of information and
          available interactions for users to play around with. With the
          previous UI, some of this information (such as the color legend
          and what statuses they were indicating, and what was being run in
          this operation) was lost because either the associations made
          between interactive and informational elements were unclear, or
          it was overshadowed by other more visible elements on the same
          page.
          <br><br>
          A lot of the consideration was put into making the new version of
          the Operations page, most importantly, on the presentation of
          information.
          <br><br>
          What is the key piece of information users need from this page?
          <br><br>
          What is necessary to give users the sense that they have control
          over this page?
          <br><br>
          To accomplish this, I borrowed and reinforced the timeline idea
          from the previous UI, and changed its layout in the new UI to
          become the main focus of the Operations page, including more
          informative status labels as well.
          <br><br>
          Since there are so many actions available on the page, I also
          grouped the actionable elements by what elements they affect, in
          hierarchical order. For example, located on the top left of the
          page are the actionable items that affect the operations as a
          whole and to the right, are the ones that affect each individual
          operation.
          <br><br>
          The main information on the page is laid out as a table, so the
          user can interact with each operation command as an individual
          entry, while still able to view them in a timeline-style.

        <h2>Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)</h2>
        <p>I worked on the Digital Accelerator (DARE) team at Charles
          Schwab, which focuses on transitioning physical (traditional,
          paper-heavy) to digital services.
          <br><br>
          As the accessibility and UX liaison on the frontend team, I
          bridged the gap between front-end, UX, and product teams, to
          digitalize the retirement and inheritance process at Schwab.
          Collaborating with the UX Research & Design team, I developed
          prototypes for three projects and developed the products for
          production.

            </span>
            <em>Demo of the RMD web app.</em>
        </span>
        <p><em>Angular, Node.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</em></p>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>The Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) web-app is the first
          project DARE tackled as a team. It was important to the Schwab
          brand to take care of all clients, and services for retired
          clients had a lot of room for improvement.</p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>One of the main issues we were particularly passionate about was
          the fact that a lot of these retired individuals‚Äìwhen it came
          time to take their annual RMDs‚Äìwould receive stacks of paper
          forms in their mail. They would then have to manually go through
          all these documents, fill out the forms, and mail back what was
          needed to Schwab.
          <br><br>
          The whole process could take months to process, and a lot of
          times, clients would default to visiting a branch in-person, or
          calling a Schwab branch for individual support.
          <br><br>
          We wanted to replicate this one-on-one, hand-holding process by
          digitalizing the Schwab retirement experience. What we started
          with was a web app that took this manual paper-process, and
          turned it into a 3-step online application.
        </p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>To design this we did multiple design workshops, user-testing
          sessions with paper and coded prototypes, and technical
          discussions to figure out what clients features they expected,
          and what they would like to see in the app.
          <br><br>
          As accessibility advocate, I participated in user research
          sessions, and collaborated with researchers to reduce confusion
          and enhance the user experience in each prototype iteration. I
          ensured the code was accessible and facilitated regular
          accessibility reviews for every new feature.
