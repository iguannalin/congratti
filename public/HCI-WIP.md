# welcome to my thesis presentation, soft networks

i was tempted to call my project the HCI, for human computer interface, but i usually tell people it's called soft
networks because i thought it would be easier to understand

but for the format of this presentation, i will still use the acronym HCI as a structure for my ideas: first, i will
talk about the human, then, i will talk about the computer, and lastly, i'll talk about the interface.

i'll begin with a quote by writer and artist Jenny Odell from her book how to do nothing...

"One thing I have learned about attention is that certain forms of it are contagious..." Emphasizing the importance of
choosing with care where our attention is focused, Odell goes on to conclude, "we might just find that everything we
wanted is already here" (How to xxiii).

sometimes i catch myself, replying to a text on my phone while walking home from the subway station, because i felt an
urgency somehow to respond in a timely manner, and i'll realize that i had magically ended up in front of my apartment.

this kind of virtuality and disembodiment that these handheld devices affords us feels like a sort of time travel, or
temporary teleportation into a virtual world, where for a moment, i forget that i have a body, or that the birds are
chirping in the trees next to me because it's spring now, or that there could be self-driving cars out on the road with
a driver behind the wheel who might be as distracted as i was on my phone.

but the harms and dangers of self-driving cars and other more recently new technology is not what i want to focus on
today. i want to focus on something that's a little more personal, something that's a little closer to me.

**i've been in a conflicted relationship with personalized devices for a long time...**

the development and improvement of almost all telecommunication devices can be traced back to military technologies.

**...which all led me to one question: why am i using the same technology used to send wartime messages to call my
grandma?**

### part i. the Human

for this section, I'd like to ask you all to take part in looking at the face of a friend or stranger next to you... if you have no-one to turn to then you can look at my face and i will do my best to look back at yours

what do you see?

i see your eyes... your nose... your lips... your ears... your skin. you are perfectly human. i wonder why you chose to wear that scarf today.



who is the I that the computer imagines? what does it see when it looks at me? who does it think i am?

maybe I, am the precariat, the proletariat that finds herself living in precarity, at the whims of the systems and
infrastructures around me

I, as someone who is traumatized by war, or in some way, still living through the aftereffects of war, and need smooth
experiences or to surround myself with smooth objects in order to pacify myself.

In the book *Are We Human?* writers Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wigley theorize that the well-designed domestic product
became a form of "art therapy for a traumatized nation: 'Good design' offers 'good life,' a galaxy of happy,
self-contained objects for people who do not feel safely contained and cannot be sure of life itself" (Colomina and
Wigley 101). Perhaps the human User is someone who is generally happy to consume and keep consuming, with bottomless
desire, someone who keeps working in order to keep buying so that they can stay happy.

### part ii. the Computer

technology has been around for a long time

i remember when i got my first computer, a dell running windows XP. i was a little kid in belize, and i remember sitting
at the desk and being able to stare at the screen for hours. sucked into the world of neopets, chatting with my friends
on MSN or QQ, finding and downloading music from the web.

When technology went from low-tech to high-tech it presented us with a virtuality, a virtual world, a virtual reality, a
disembodiment from our current reality

We succumb to it because technology feeds on our natural desire for community (Odell)

### part iii. the Interface

Speaking on the significance of the metaphor, George Lakoff and Mark Johnsen write, "the concepts that govern our
thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our everyday functioning, down to the most mundane
details" (Lakoff and Johnsen 4).

that is to say, the tools we use will significantly shape the way we think

like how the language we choose is ultimately a cloak for our thoughts and feelings

Media scholar Quelic Berga gives a concrete example of this designed metaphor paradigm in a piece for the critical
interface manifesto, "there is no real recycling bin in your PC, you do not have 530 people following you, and you
didn't save anything on any cloud. But these conventions help us to understand certain processes" (Berga).

soft networks is an amalgamation, of fleece yarn left over from a garment manufacturer in New York, tufted on recycled
burlap bags that once carried coffee beans from Guatemala and Peru, and wifi-enabled microcontrollers from the UK.

it is a network both in the physical sense and in the metaphysical sense--it is a net made of yarn carrying nodes that,
when touched, will send messages to each other via sockets on a local network

weaved into this project is a welcoming message--an invitation to join in the re-imagination of the quotidian
communication networks we engage with, and to participate in investigating the intentions of the technology we use, many
of which have origins that can be traced back to weapons of war, or are surveilled by private institutions.

in the making of this project, i was inspired by maintenance art, a blatant refusal in the face of this
productivity-obsessed society

namely, the junkyard assemblage art of Noah Purifoy, the maintenance art manifesto of Mierle Laderman Ukeles, the
crochet works by mathematician Daina Taimiņa, the writings of Ursula K LeGuin, Shannon Mattern, and Jenny Odell, among
many others

this act of staying in the present, and paying attention to what's already here is also a refusal to the consumerist
ideal of always creating new, because with everything new that is created, it requires someone to keep maintaining it.

in this age of technology where we've been reduced to taps and clicks, i want to remind us of our bodies, that we still
live here presently in this world, to remind us of technology that comes naturally to our bodies because we already know
what to do with it--there is no onboarding, no need for someone to teach us how to use it because it is intuitive, it is
something we can feel.
