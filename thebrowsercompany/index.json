      "The Arc browser has transformed the way I browse the web, and organize my endless open tabs in the form of notes, folders, spaces. It has also transformed the way I think about personalized technology--there is a lot of room to challenge the traditional software paradigms, and experiment with alternate infrastructures."

    "summary": "What",
    "details": [
      "As an undergraduate studying psychology, I participated and conducted research experiments, and taught a class on psychological research methods as a teaching assistant. However, my interest in coding led me to pursue computer science. Though I graduated with a degree in psychology, I taught myself code and began working full-time as a frontend software engineer after college. After 4 years, my desire to explore more creative implementations of technology led me to pursue a masters degree in creative technology at NYU.",
      "Generally, my past work has involved working with teams, ranging from small to large, to provide access to data to a greater group of people. I have worked in all stages of developmentâ€“from design, to building accessible prototypes to be used in user research, to production-ready software, as well as maintaining the codebase and pull requests."
