        <h4>hello, welcome to my website.</h4>
        <p>the last time this website was completely changed was in
          2018.</p>
        <p>websites are always a work in progress; i hope this new website
          is a better reflection of how i feel about websites now--they can
          be plain
          javascript + html, and they can be fun (!) because it leaves room
          for more important things--like
          accessibility, maintenance, and room to grow.</p>
        <p>my old website had ~406 MB of assets; this one has <a
          href="https://github.com/iguannalin/congratti/tree/main"
          target="_blank"

            <span><img
              alt="A pink, orange, and dark purple net cascades from the ceiling, obscuring two people hugging nodes inside the net, one person is holding a phone, and the other person is smiling."
              loading="lazy"
              src="public/touched.jpg"/></span>
            <p>The soft networks is a net made of nodes that communicate to each other by touches--when one person hugs a node, a message is sent to all the other nodes which can be felt by another person.</p>
          </span>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>soft networks is crafted with a mixture of mediums and methods
          questioning the origins of the technology we use and playing with
          the many meanings that the net carries.
        </p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>soft networks is a net made of yarn carrying nodes that will
          send messages to each other via sockets on a local network when
          touched.</p>
        <p>Each node consists of recycled burlap and fleece yarn, a <a
          href="public/microcontroller.jpeg">small board</a> with a
          Raspberry Pi Zero, which starts a server and listens for
          messages, and also controls 2 mini haptic motors.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Embodied in the speculative nature of soft networks is the
          question to phone users everywhere: what are the different ways
          you could be communicating to me?</p>
        <p>This project culminated in a 1-day show co-created with jo, sim,
          neeti, and angie.</p>

              drawing program called Kid Pix (2000) on the iMac.</p>
          </span>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>Computing can be a lonely experience, and sometimes when you go
          through a difficult virtual
          experience it would be nice to still have a hand holding you
          through it in the physical realm.
        </p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>This was a project created in collaboration with <a
          href="https://k--k.net/">Kat Kitay</a>.</p>
        <p>The model was a modified version of a <a
          href="https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/hands-3d-1961009">hand
          model</a> that was 3D-printed, and <a
          href="public/handpaint.jpg"
          title="picture of hand being spray-painted">lovingly
          spray-painted</a>.
          The hardware was taken from an HP optical mouse, and fit into the
          back of the handhold mouse.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>A conversation that I had with a lot of people who came to play
          with this project was about how playful
          personal computing was in the past. Thank you to these people for
          reminiscing with me, and for sharing these
          insights in conversation with me.</p>
        <p>What are alternatives for personal computers today? What are the
          ways our computer acknowledges the
          corporeal?</p>

            <p>Twins using the EEG devices, and controlling different sets of the lights in the EEG cloud, based on
              activity levels in their brain.</p>
          </span>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>Communication often fails us--mispronunciation,
          misinterpretation, other mishaps; we wanted to explore a
          different way of communicating our thoughts, and feelings about a
          situation, using our brainwaves.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>This project was created in collaboration with <a
          href="https://danielwai.myportfolio.com/">Daniel Wai</a>,
          and with a lot
          of advice on EEG devices, as well as how to read its data from <a
            href="https://jasonjsnell.com/">Jason
            Snell</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The EEG cloud consists of two sets of LED lights suspended in
          the air. Each pair of lights is connected to
          one of the two Muse 2 (EEG sensing device) devices. Participants
          are invited in pairs to put on one of the
          Muse 2 devices, which will record their brain activity. The EEG
          data is sent to the Arduino paired with the
          LED lights via WiFi, and the LED lights reflect a different color
          based on the state of the participants'
          mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This was an interesting exploration of what alternate forms of
          communication, and expression could look
          like. When this project was presented as part of the ITP 2023
          Spring Show (for the class Intangible
          Interactions by Yeseul Song), we received a lot of interesting
          ideas from people.</p>
        <p>For example, what if we could have EEG-controlled lighting in
          our homes--a pre-anticipation of mood
          lighting? Or what if we use this as a trauma recovery therapeutic
          device, to guide us in our mental state on
          how we feel about a certain subject before we can verbalize it by
          allowing us to express it in a gentler,
          passive way?</p>

            <p>A <a
              href="https://iguannalin.github.io/ai-loves-horror/about.html">horror text-based adventure game</a>
              made using OpenAI's GPT-3 (Davinci model) API. This project was shown during the ITP Winter Show, 2022.
            </p>
          </span>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>It's an homage to old-school text based adventure games, and an
          exploration of AI's ability to write an
          emotionally compelling story for the player.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>The app sends a prompt to Davinci to write a text-based
          adventure game that will give players choices
          numbered 1-3. When a choice is made, it is added back to the
          entire story, and sent as a prompt to Davinci
          to
          send more choices, until the story is finished.</p>
        <p>The story changes every time it is run, and it is generated live
          during gameplay. Ony Davinci has control
          over the choices, and when to end the game.</p>
        <p>The pace of the text also increases the longer the player
          plays.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>It's interesting how Davinci is able to create a cohesive story
          that follows the theme of a horror
          adventure game. The stories Davinci generates usually consists of
          one spooky figure in a strange place, and
          the player is given choices to confront the figure or run
          away.</p>
        <p>Somehow, the story always ends in about 5 minutes or so, and
          Davinci almost always gives a somewhat
          optimistic ending.</p>

          </span>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>During the pandemic, i wanted to remind my friends, and myself
          that there are brighter times ahead.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>I created a Python app that runs on a scheduler to use the
          Twilio SMS API, sending a text to subscribed
          numbers during random times of throughout the day.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Texting seems to be a pretty non-intrusive way of reaching out
          to people that can be made into a positive
          experience.</p>
        <p>It made me happy to hear from a friend that the random texts
          throughout the day did help them through a
          tough time.</p>
