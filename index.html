                        <h4>about this website</h3>
                        <p>the last time i completely changed my website was in 2018.</p>
                        <p>websites are always a work in progress; this change has been due when my old website no longer reflected me--as someone who continues to work in, and have a love-hate relationship with technology.</p>
                        <p>my old website was ~406 MB; this one is ~100 MB (photos)</p>
                        <p>if the old website described me as a person, it would paint this picture: someone getting into fancy javascript libraries, server-side bundling, and a bit of a code hoarder for fear of needing it later in the future.</p>
                        <p>i hope this new website is a better reflection of how i feel about websites now--it can be plain javascript + html, and it can be fun because it leaves room for more important things--like accessiblity, maintenance, and room to grow.</p>

                        </h2>

                            <p>A <a href="https://iguannalin.github.io/ai-loves-horror/about.html">horror text-based adventure game</a> made using OpenAI's GPT-3 (Davinci model) API. This project was shown during the ITP Winter Show, 2022.</p>
                        </span>
                        <h3>Why</h3>
                        <p>It's an homage to old-school text based adventure games, and an exploration of AI's ability to write an emotionally compelling story for the player.</p>
                        <h3>How</h3>
                        <p>The app sends a prompt to Davinci to write a text-based adventure game that will give players choices numbered 1-3. When a choice is made, it is added back to the entire story and sent as a prompt to Davinci to send more choices, until the story is finished.</p>
                        <p>The story changes every time it is run, and it is generated live during gameplay. Ony Davinci has control over the choices and when to end the game.</p><p>The pace of the text also increases the longer the player plays.</p>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>It's interesting how Davinci is able to create a cohesive story that follows the theme of a horror adventure game. The stories Davinci generates usually consists of one spooky figure in a strange place, and the player is given choices to confront the figure or run away.</p>
                        <p>Somehow, the story always ends in about 5 minutes or so, and Davinci almost always gives a somewhat optimistic ending.</p>

                        </span>
                        <h3>Why</h3>
                        <p>During the pandemic, i wanted to remind my friends and myself that there are brighter times ahead.</p>
                        <h3>How</h3>
                        <p>I created Python app that runs on a scheduler to use the Twilio SMS API to send a text to subscribed numbers.</p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>Texting seems to be a pretty non-intrusive way of reaching out to people that can be made into a positive experience.</p>
                        <p>It made me happy to hear from a friend that the random texts throughout the day did help them through a tough time.</p>

                            <p>Squishy Sounds (AKA baby killer as our friends called it) was a collaborative project with Efrat Levy, to make playing music a sensory experience.</p>
                        </span>
                        <h3>Why</h3>
                        <p>We wanted to reimagine what musical peripherals could be like if we experiemented with color, shape and material.</p>
                        <h3>How</h3>
                        <p>We created pastel colored shapes using molded silicon and connected them to wires to use as a capacitive sensor. Then we added sounds to it via serial communication from an Arduino to p5.</p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>While possible, it was difficult to control the sensitivity of the silicon as sensors. The silicon is delightful to play with but in the future i would explore different sensory materials.</p><a href="https://annaylin.notion.site/Squishy-Sounds-7924d6fe83d74175b406fa459df959b7">Read more about it here.</a></div>

                        </span>
                        <h3>Why</h3>
                        <p>Growing up using Apple Music, I enjoyed the auto-generated top 20 songs playlist--a feature that I miss since using Spotify.</p>
                        <h3>How</h3>
                        <p>I found out that closest I could get to creating an auto-generated top 20 songs playlist was to use the Spotify API to get a list of all my tracks, sorted in the order they were added, and send the latest 20 to the playlist creation endpoint.</p>
                        <p>It took some time figuring out the authentication, and while it is a hassle, it works pretty well once you authenticate and get redirected to the app.</p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>There's not much customization you could do with generating playlists this way--for example, it would have been fun to play around with making an auto-generated playlist cover image as well.</p>

                        <h3>Why</h3>
                        <p>I created a <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/iguannalin/full/MrbmRhW1V"> generative art piece</a> for a Riso print exhibit.</p>
                        <h3>How</h3>
                        <p>The code creates a unique combination of petals and stems every time it's run, given rules to resemble a flower.</p>
                        <p>It picks from a list of communities i wish were better represented and more supported financially to generate the phrase in the piece. The final pieces were each printed with 2 Riso colors on ecru paper.</p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>It was a good introduction for me to Riso printing with P5 in a class called Print &amp; Code by Tega Brain. The assignment was to create a political poster, but i don't know how well this serves as a message. i definitely had a lot of fun creating the code for generating a unique composition.</p>
